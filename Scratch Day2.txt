Amsible
-one of the most common automation tool made by Red Rat, used in configuring cisco devices,
also in Linux(with ssh Enable)
- Ansible is Agentless, it means is does not require any software to be installed on the remote device
It only requires IP Add and pingable.

- Ansible runs on Linux OS only and based on Python.( case and space sensitive source conding, using Tab key
can be problematic)

-Ansible source file is .yml(using an markup language called YAML)
Yet, Another, Markup, Language

-To setup, it requires the control Machine (where the devices assumes control to remote devices)
, and Remote Machine (devices that is being remtely configured automatically)
